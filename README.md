# customer-segmentation-analysis
Customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company using K-Means clustering in Python to identify distinct customer groups and inform targeted marketing strategies.

This data analytics project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company by analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.
Key Concepts and Challenges:

# Key Concepts and Challenges:
* **Data Collection**: Obtained a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and relevant data.
 
* **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Explored the dataset, understood its structure, and handled any missing or inconsistent data.

* **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc..

* **Customer Segmentation**: Utilized clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.

* **Visualization**: Created visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments.

 # Technologies Used:



* **Python**

* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

* **Scikit-learn** (for KMeans clustering and StandardScaler)

* **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

* **Seaborn** (for enhanced visualizations)
